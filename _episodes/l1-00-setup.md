Completing this course requires you to have access to a computer with Git installed and
a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. This course is currently being delivered in
person and remotely so please make sure you have access to a suitable computer. All
attendees should configure their `recipe` repository and be comfortable with using Git.

## Configure your recipe repository

- Download [this zip archive](code/recipe_with_history.zip) that contains the `recipe`
repo with some previous commit history that will be used in the session.
- Extract it into your home directory.
- Create a repository on your personal GitHub account and set it as the remote for this
`recipe` repository you have locally.

If you do not know how to do this, you can follow the steps in the "Configuring
a remote repository from a local one" exercise in
[this lesson.](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/introductory_grad_school_git_course/l2-02-remote_repositories/index.html)


## Install Git

> ## Important!
>
> If you do not already have Git installed or are not comfortable with using it for
> simple version control tasks, you should consider attending our
> [Introduction to using Git and GitHub for software development][intro-course] course
> first.

Please follow the relevant instructions depending on your operating system.

### Windows

1. Download the Git for Windows [installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
1. Run the installer and follow the steps below:
   1. Click on "Next" four times (two times if you've previously installed Git). You don't need to change anything in the Information, location, components, and start menu screens.
   1. From the dropdown menu select "Use the nano editor by default" and click on "Next".
   1. Ensure that "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected and click on "Next". (If you don't do this Git Bash will not work properly, requiring you to remove the Git Bash installation, re-run the installer and to select the "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" option.)
   1. Ensure that "Use the native Windows Secure Channel library" is selected and click on "Next".
   1. Ensure that "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" is selected and click on "Next".
   1. Ensure that "Use Windows' default console window" is selected and click on "Next".
   1. Ensure that "Enable file system caching" and "Enable Git Credential Manager" are selected and click on "Next".
   1. Click on "Install".
   1. Click on "Finish".
1. If your "HOME" environment variable is not set (or you don't know what this is):
   1. Open command prompt (Open Start Menu then type `cmd` and press [Enter])
   1. Type the following line into the command prompt window exactly as shown:
   1. `setx HOME "%USERPROFILE%"`
   1. Press [Enter], you should see `SUCCESS: Specified value was saved`.
   1. Quit command prompt by typing `exit` then pressing [Enter]

This will provide you with both Git and Bash via the program Git Bash. You
should be able to launch Git Bash from the Start Menu. Within the window that
launches enter the command `git --version` and press enter. You should see
output similar to the below:
```
git version 2.40.0.windows-1
```

### MacOS

Apple provide a suite of UNIX-style command line tools that includes git. Install
them by opening the "Terminal" app and running:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
```

This will open  dialog that asks for your confirmation to install the tools. If
it does not open a dialog, it may be because it is already installed (the error
message will be clear).

To check the installation was successful open the "Terminal" app. In the window
that launches enter the command `git --version` and press enter. You should see
output similar to the below:
```
git version 2.37.1 (Apple Git-137.1)
```

**If the above does not work**, you may have and older version of MacOS.
Try the following: install Git for Mac by downloading and running the
most recent "mavericks" installer from [this list][installer-list]. Because this
installer is not signed by the developer, you may have to right click (control
click) on the .pkg file, click Open, and click Open on the pop up window. After
installing Git, there will not be anything in your `/Applications` folder, as
Git is a command line program. **For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)** use
the most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard" [available
here][snow-leopard].

### Linux

If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to install it via
your distributions package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run `sudo apt-get install
git` and for Fedora run `sudo dnf install git`.

To check the installation was successful open a new terminal. In the window that
launches enter the command `git --version` and press enter. You should see
output similar to the below:
```
git version 2.40.0
```
